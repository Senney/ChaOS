ChaOS
=====

### Pre-Requisites

- gcc 
- nasm
- ld
- bochs (-x, -sdl)
- libsdl-dev

### Running

Execute 'make' in the root ChaOS directory. Follow by running bochs
in the same directory. Once the grub boot-loader pops up, run the
following:

kernel 200+18

boot

The kernel should then be loaded. This is being fixed in future iterations.

### Libaility

I am not liable for any damages. It's your own bloody fault for running my 
shit code.
